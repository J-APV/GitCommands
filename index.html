        <p style="font-weight: bold;">In order to push something to Github, your code will have to go through 3 stages<p>
        <ol>
          <li>Adding your new/updated files into the "staging" area:</li>
          <code>git add . </code><span>(Which means add the current directory to the staging area)</span>
          <div>OR alternatively, if you want to only add one file to github, you can just add that specific file</div>
          <code>git add HelloWorld.txt</code>
        
          <li>Add your "staged" files include a small description of what feature you are pushing to commit your changes:</li>
          <code>git commit -m "Add commit message here"</code>
          <li>Finally, you upload your commited work onto github:</li>
          <code>git push origin main</code>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="center">
        <div class="info">
          <p><strong>Note:</strong><br>You can do <code>git pull</code> to get the most recent version of the Github repo. <br> Make sure to always update your codebase before coding away :D</p>

    <h2 class="center">How to use Git when working on teams?</h2>
   </div>
  <div class="instructions">
    <p>These 3 commands are enough if you're working on a project alone. However, when working in a team, you have to worry about having the most recent version of the code, while also making sure your changes aren't conflicting with others' code or vice versa.</p>
    <p>For this reason, git has a feature called "branches". It's like creating a seperate timeline from the main timeline. Your branch will copy the recent code and you will be able to make changes to it without worrying about interfering with other's making changes.
      You will work in your branch until your feature is completely finished. Once finished, you will retrieve the most recent version of the Github repository and merge your branch onto the main repository.
    </p>
    <span><b>These are the commands you have to do:</b></span>
    <ol>
      <li><code>git branch [branch-name]</code> *It is recommended to make your branch name like this: [nameinitials_feature] ex: japv_shoppingcart</li> 
      <li><code>git checkout [branch-name]</code> *This switches you from the "main" branch onto the branch you just made!</li> 
      <div class="info code">
        <p><strong>Alternatively... you can do those 2 steps in one line like this: <br></strong><br>
                    
            1.) <code>git checkout -b [branch-name]</code> *The <code>-b</code> means "git, please create a new branch"
          </p>
      </div>
      <li><code>git fetch</code> *This just gets the most recent version of the code, similar to pull but it won't make changes to your files just yet</li>
      <li><code>git push -u origin [branch-name]</code> *This pushes the branch onto Github so your teammates can also join your branch if you need to work together</li>
      <p>You should add and commit your code often! This will save your code on github just in case anything bad happens! If something happens to the files your working on, you can always go back to them on your github branch :D </p>
      <li><code>git add .</code></li>
      <li><code>git commit -m "description here"</code></li>
      <h5 class="center">Once you're finished with your feature/task and you're ready to merge:</h5>
      <li><code>git fetch</code> *Making sure your main repo is the most recent</li>
      <li><code>git checkout main</code></li>
      <li><code>git merge [branch-name]</code>*Merges your branch onto main</li>
      <li><code>git push origin main</code> *Pushes your version of the code(merged version) onto github</li>
      <h5 class="center">Now, we should delete your branches that exist remotely and also locally in your computer</h5>
      <li><code>git push origin :[branch-name]</code> *The semi-colon is important and tells git to "delete". (This deletes branch remotely)</li>
      <li><code>git branch -D [branch-name]</code> *Deletes the branch from your local repository</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <hr>
    <h2 class="center">Some extra notes:</h2>
    <div class="instructions">
      <p>If 2 or more people are working with similar files, it’s important to switch to their branch instead of creating your own branch:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><code>git fetch</code> *Gets any branches that may exist in the Github</li>
        <li><code>git branch -a</code> *To see all branches, including your branches and remote branches</li>
        <li><code>git switch [desired-remote-branch-name]</code> *Switches to the branch X person is working on</li>
      </ol>

    <h2 class="center">Vocabulary</h2>
    <div class="instructions">
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li> <b>Pushing</b> on git (means uploading your code onto the github repository and saving it there)</li>
          <li> <b>Pull</b> on git(means getting the most recent version from github and changes your files to recent)</li>
          <li> <b>Fetch</b> on git(means getting the most recent version but it doesn’t change your files until u merge)</li>
          <li> <b>Forking</b> (means grabbing someone else’s REPO on github but it’s saved under you. So when u push, it will save under the repo you own, instead of the person you got it from)</li>
          <li> <b>Branch</b> (Alternate repository so you can create new features without affecting the working code)</li>
          <li> <b>Origin</b> - Refers to github remote or “original” repo</li>
          <li> <b>Main</b> - where the working code goes.</li>
          <li> The command <code>-a</code> means “all”</li>
          <li> The command <code>-b</code> means “create a new branch” ex: git checkout -b [branch-name]</li>
          <li> The command <code>-u</code> means “upstream branch” and it allows git to track the branch you created and links it to a branch on github. So now you can do git pull when working on a branch without specifying what branch you want to pull from.</li>
        </ul>
